But delay not long in this house, peaceful though it is, for evil is on the march outside. The nine riders, the nazgul, whom you may have 
encountered, cannot be destroyed, save through destruction of the One Ring.  But events far away are in motion - the hosts of Mordor are gathering 
and are preparing to assail Gondor from all directions. Also trust not the paths to the south, beware of the Gap of Rohan and draw not near to 
Isengard, as the wizard Saruman is in league with the Dark Tower and prepares for war. Now you are appointed this doom - to carry the ring back to the fires 
from whence it came, the fires of Mount Doom.  Mordor lies far away to the southeast, across the Misty Mountains, across great rivers and deserts, 
and through many perils.  You must choose your path - either north, east, or south. But fear not, may Varda shine a light on your path.  I will look in 
on you from time to time. Sincerely, Gandalf/false/false/false/false/false/-1/false/false/false/false/#

pavillion below.  Farewell Frodo, may the star of Earendil be your guide when all other lights have failed!/
